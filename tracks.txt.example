# This is an example file of how to write the tracks.txt file on your installation:
#
# 1) Copy this file and name the copy: tracks.txt
# 2) Erase any line starting with # from the tracks.txt (not from tracks.txt.example)
# 3) Write or copy the track list in any of the following formats:
#    - Dashes (-) can be omitted
#    - Time can be writen in HH:MM:SS or MM:SS format.
#    - If the list is numbered, tracks can be from 1 to 99 (at the moment)
#    - If time is over the logical constrains (00 <= HH <= 23, 00 <= MM, SS <= 59) then the out of
#      bounds digit(s) will be omitted:
#      ex1: MM:SS=67:61 will result in 7:6
#      ex2: HH:MM:SS=24:05:01 will result in 24:05
#
# Sharp (#) placed at the first in the line indicates the line is a comment!
