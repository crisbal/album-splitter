# album-splitter

Use **album-splitter** to automatically split any audio file (youtube videos, albums, podcasts, audiobooks, tapes, vinyls) into separate tracks starting from timestamps. album-splitter will also take care of tagging each part with the correct metadata. If your file is on YouTube, you can download it automatically.

## Quick guide (from a local album)

+ Create a copy of the `tracks.txt.example`, rename it as `tracks.txt`
+ Open `tracks.txt`
+ Add your tracks timestamps info in this format:
    * `<start-time> - <title>`
    * A track on each line
    * See *Examples* section, many other formats supported
+ Run the script
    * Basic usage: `python -m album_splitter --file <path/to/your/album.mp3>`
    * More in the *Examples* section
+ Wait for the splitting process to complete
+ You will find your tracks in the `./splits/` folder

## Quick guide (from a YouTube video)

+ Copy the YouTube URL of the album you want to download and split
+ Find in the YouTube comments the tracklist with start-time and title
+ Create a copy of the `tracks.txt.example`, rename it as `tracks.txt`
+ Open `tracks.txt`
+ Copy the tracklist in the file, adjusting for the supported formats
    * `<start-time> - <title>`
    * A track on each line
+ Run the script
    * Basic usage: `python -m album_splitter -yt <youtube_url>`
    * More in the *Examples* section
+ Wait for the Download and for the conversion
+ Wait for the splitting process to complete
+ You will find your tracks in the `./splits` folder

## Output Format

The format of the output tracks is the same as the format of the input (same extension, same codec, same bitrate, ...), it simply does a copy of the codec. If you want to convert the output tracks to a different format, you can do this using additional tools.

For example to convert from `.wav` to `.mp3` you can use FFmpeg. [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41207442) is how you can do it on Linux/macOS. [This](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ffmpeg-batch/) or [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56244203) might help for Windows instead. You can adopt such snippets to do other processing, such as changing the bitrate.

## Examples

### Downloading and splitting an album from YouTube

+ This is the album I want to download and split: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_uqD4ng9hw`
+ I find the tracklist in the comments and I copy that in `tracks.txt`, eventually adjusting it to a supported format for the tracklist
+
```
00:06 - When I Was Young
...
14:48 - Pretty Little Girl
```

+ I execute `python -m album_splitter -yt "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_uqD4ng9hw"` and wait
+ Once the process is complete I open the `./splits` and I find all my songs:
```
    When I Was Young.mp3
    ...
    Pretty Little Girl.mp3
```
These songs are already mp3-tagged with their track name and track number, but not their author or their album, since we have not specified it.

### Splitting and tagging with Author and Album a local file

+ I somehow got the file `DogsEatingDogsAlbum.mp3` that I want to split
+ I set the tracklist in `tracks.txt` (same tracks as before)
+ I execute `python -m album_splitter --file DogsEatingDogsAlbum.mp3 --album "Dogs Eating Gods" --artist "blink-182" --folder "2012 - Dogs Eating Dogs"`
+ The software will execute, it will split the album, and mp3-tag each track with the author and the album name I passed as a parameter (as well as track number and name). It will also put the files in the folder passed as an argument (instead of putting them in the default `./splits` folder)
+ To add an image you have saved locally as album artwork to the tracks, add the option `--artwork "./path/to/artwork.jpeg"`.

## Supported formats for the track list (`tracks.txt`)

These are just some examples, find more in `tracks.txt.example`.

* `[hh:]mm:ss - Title`
* `Title - [hh:]mm:ss`
* `Title [hh:]mm:ss`

To just see which data would be extracted from the tracklist use the option `--dry-run`.
